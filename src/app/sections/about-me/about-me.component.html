    <h4>
      I love writing codes as well as painting and designing, so my interest in front-end development raised from these
      two interests of mine. I followed my dreams and learned all I needed. So I did multiple projects including this
      portfolio website.
      Currently you can find me creating new features and pages mainly using Angular, JavaScript and Typescript at
      Myket.
      Prior to Myket, I was busy bringing web designs pixel by pixel into life at Trustply.
